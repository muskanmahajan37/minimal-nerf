# minimal-nerf

This program is a minimal PyTorch implementation of NeRF (https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08934). Note that the purpose of this program is not to exactly reproduce the original paper and it is missing  many of the advanced 
features. This program serves as a practical demonstration on how to train a neural radiance field using PyTorch
